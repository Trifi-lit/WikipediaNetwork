# WikipediaNetwork
I created a code in a python that generates a directed graph (G), whose nodes are article titles from Wikipedia. Every edge (u,v) exists if the article titled u can lead you directly to article v through a hyperlink in its content. The initial article I chose for to run my code is "GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems". The analysis of the network both through the networkx library as well as through gephi gave enough interesting information on the nature of the networks are created by wikipedia hyperlinks but also about the starting article I chose.

The network created through gephi can be seen in the third page of the greek_presentation&analysis file.
